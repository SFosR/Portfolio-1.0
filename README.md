Portfolio 1.0 for Sheri Foster

https://sfosr.github.io/Portfolio-1.0/

Currently a student in a coding bootcamp through Ohio State University, this first attempt at a portfolio showcases just a few of my projects. Follow the links to glance at my projects and to contact me directly. 

Most importantly, come back for another visit to see how my works progresses. 

Thank you.
